            An initial public offering (IPO) marks a significant milestone for a private company as it transitions into the realm of publicly traded entities. This financial event involves the issuance of new shares to the public for the first time, allowing the company to raise capital by selling ownership stakes. The IPO process typically unfolds through an underwriting agreement with investment banks, which facilitate the sale of shares to institutional and retail investors.

            The IPO market serves as a dynamic and essential component of the broader financial landscape, acting as a conduit for companies to access public capital and fuel their growth strategies. It provides an avenue for investors to participate in the early stages of a company's public journey, offering the potential for capital appreciation as the firm expands its operations and captures market share.

            Investors keen on participating in an IPO often engage in the process of buying and selling shares through various platforms. The application for IPO shares involves investors submitting bids at specified prices, expressing their interest in acquiring a portion of the newly issued shares. This demand, in turn, helps determine the final IPO price and allocation of shares to successful bidders.
